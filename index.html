        <strong> The Ukrainian Carpathians</strong> are a section of the Eastern
        Carpathians, within the borders of modern Ukraine. They are located in
        the southwestern corner of <em>Western Ukraine</em>, within
        administrative territories of four Ukrainian regions (oblasts), covering
        northeastern part of Zakarpattia Oblast, southwestern part of Lviv
        Oblast, southern half of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast and western half of
        Chernivtsi Oblast.
